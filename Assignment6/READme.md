In Assignment 6, we learned how a stack behaves and practice programming in C. We made a stack, storing the stack data in an array. Our stack.c file has functions push, pop, and printStack, while our stack.h contains the prototype of all the stack functions. We use stack.c to implement a driver program called driver.c. This program prompts the user to either push to the stack, pop the stack, and print the stack in either decimal, hexadecimal, or character format. 

This is my first time coding in C, and the syntax is very similar to Java, so I am kind of comfortable with this assignment. It was a bit of a challenge learning some of the principles of pointers and arrays in C, but it was still interesting and I'm looking forward to coding in C in the future.
