In Assignment 2, we made an LC-3 assembly program that counted ones in a value stored in memory location x3100. The counter is stored in memory location x3101. The data and addones files are programs that we were required to observe on the LC-3 simulator to see how it worked.

This was a nice introduction to assembly language. Although it took a while to figure everything out, it was still fun coding in assembly.
